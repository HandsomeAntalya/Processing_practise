## Task one (week 4 /2023.2.13)
Warming up:​
 Draw a face on the egg using ellipse(), rect(), line(), arc() etc. Tip: place these in the Egg Class ‘display’ function, consider where to add them to the function’s sequence of drawing. Don’t forgot colour with fill() and stroke()​

Challenges:​
 Create a new class and add it to the composite EggRing class. Consider starting with something simple like placing the egg on a podium (or a hat?).

## Task two 
Warming up:​
 Randomise the colour of each set of lines.​
 Change the lines to circles.​

Challenges:​

 Rather than have 4 MRect variables, try creating an array of MRect.
 Create a new ‘update’ function within MRect that reduces the number of bars by one. Try calling this function on every mouse press.
